<strong>Kernel Exploits</strong>

What is a kernel?
It is a computer program that is an interface between hardware and software programs. Essentially it is a translator. Researching the kernel and understanding it on a fundamental level will help you understand exploits and potentially find futre exploits. It is a vital thing to know and understand as a security researcher.

There is a github called Windows-Kernel-Exploits that lists all of the kernel exploits.

If you own the kernel you own the system. It is probably one of the best ways to do privilege escalation on Windows.
