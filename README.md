# Hacking-Study-Guide

This is a variety of notes I will be taking as I study for various certification exams such as the PNTP, OSCP, and eJPT among others. While this is supposed to be a resource for myself I think it may be helpful for those studying for these exams.

If you have any suggestions please feel free to contact me.

You use these notes at your own risk.
