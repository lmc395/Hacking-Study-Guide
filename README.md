<strong> Hacking-Study-Guide </strong>

This is my hacking study guide. It is meant to be a general study guide for certifications such as eJPT, PNTP, and OSCP among others. If you have a suggestion or addition to these notes please let me know. You are free to use these notes to help you study for what ever test you wish.

I will be adding to this resource on a semi-regular basis.
